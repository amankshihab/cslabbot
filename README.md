Hey You!
yes you... 
would u like to run me on your systemðŸ˜‰...... here's how




Run me on your system
======================
Firstly you must have [python 3.7.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379) installed on your system 
if you don't have it yet then just go ahead and install it first.


Ohh....
Seems like I forgot something ...hmmmm
Ohh yeah ..
you do have to download this repo as a zip file and extract it or you could clone me to your pc.

Now to make sure that you have all the packages installed use cmd and
navigate to the folder containing the folder containing this file and type :	


    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
~Sometimes the telegram module may not get installed then just try this (Windows):~

~python -m pip install python-telegram-bot~
    
You can now compile the code on your pc and commit it here
