This is a telegram bot created by the students of CSA FISAT for the students of CSA FISAT.


Hey You!
yes you...
would u like to run me on your systemðŸ˜‰...... here's how

======================
Run me on your system
======================
Firstly you must have python3.7.9 installed on your system 
if you don't have it yet then just go ahead and installed 
it first `~python here~<https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/>`_

Ohh....
Seems like I forgot something ...hmmmm
Ohh yeah ..
you do have to download this as a zip file and extract it or you could clone me into your pc.

Now to make sure that you have all the packages installed use cmd and 
navigate to the folder containing the this file and type
-cmd::

    pip install requirements.txt
    
Sometimes the telegram module may not get installed then just try this (Windows)::

    python -m pip install python-telegram-bot
    
You can now compile it on your pc and commit it here


================================
Important Notice(For new users)
================================

Before you try and make a commit always make sure that it does'nt make conflict with the main branch.

Also try to make a pull request and commit it to a seperate branch if it has major developement on it.

....thanks a lot on the contribution
